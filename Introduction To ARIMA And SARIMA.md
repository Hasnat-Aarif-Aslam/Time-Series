# **where AIC and BIC are useful beyond ARMA/ARIMA:**
* AIC and BIC can be used for any type of model, whether it’s regression, time series, or even machine learning models, where you are trying to choose between different models.


# **SARIMA**
* SARIMA is used for time series that have seasonality, which means they repeat patterns over regular intervals (like monthly sales, temperatures, etc.).

`*THE NORMAL p,d,q WILL HANDLE TRENDS AND P,D,Q,m WILL HANDLE THE SEASONALITY (SARIMA IS JUST A COMBINATION OF BOTH TRENDS AND SEASONALITY)*`
